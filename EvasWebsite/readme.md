# RoadMap

## Keys
The order in which we should work on this website, with security out of the way and a few vertical
slices we can continue to look into the other functionality and design of the website. The most
important is how the website looks and feels and then functionality and speed.

1. <del>Security</del> 
2. Design/UX
3. Funcionality
4. Speed
5. Data


## Pages
1. Consistent Design Philosophy
2. Singular CSS
3. Switch to Bootstrap, better for mobile development
4. Implement the rest of the pages i.e. Store, Index etc.
5. Finish the code behind

## Data
1. Finish the tables
2. Where should the SQL methods be stored? In their data classes or data_layer class?
3. Implement functions to show SQL data
4. Implement LINQ functionality if it's faster
